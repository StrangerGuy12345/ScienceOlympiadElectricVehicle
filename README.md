# ScienceOlympiadElectricVehicle
This repository gives the code files for programming your Electric Vehicle for the Science Olympiad utilizing the Arduino platform.
# Requirments
You will need an Arduino or ESP32 (I used the [Arduino Uno R4 Wifi](https://shorturl.at/gxt6B) due to the extra storage and faster download and upload rate), this [Motor with Encoder](https://shorturl.at/rNqjS), and this [LCD](https://shorturl.at/NttRC). You will also need to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed with the board manager for the model of your microcontroller installed. You may use [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://cloud.arduino.cc/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2bfHjMKjigMVwU1HAR2jpREhEAAYASAAEgL1nPD_BwE) if you're using more than one device.
