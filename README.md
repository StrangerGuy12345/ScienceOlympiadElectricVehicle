# ScienceOlympiadElectricVehicle
This repository gives the code files for programming your Electric Vehicle for the Science Olympiad utilizing the Arduino platform.

To use this code you will need an Arduino or ESP32 (I used the Arduino Uno R4 Wifi due to the extra storage and faster download and upload rate), this Encoder: https://shorturl.at/rNqjS, and this LCD: https://shorturl.at/NttRC.
